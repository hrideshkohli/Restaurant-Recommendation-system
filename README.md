# Restaurant-Recommendation-system

This project is about creating a machine learning based restaurant recommendation system. A recommender system is an extended class of applications that involves predicting responses to a variety of options.

## How the Restaurant Recommendation System Works?

The rapid growth in data collection has led to a new era of a data-driven world. Data is used to create more efficient systems and that’s where recommender systems come in.

Recommendation systems are a type of **information filtering systems** because they improve the quality of search results and provide elements that are more relevant to the search item or that are related to the search history of the user.

These are active information filtering systems that personalize the information provided to a user based on their interests, relevance of the information, etc. **Recommendation systems** are widely used to recommend movies, items, restaurants, places to visit, items to buy, etc.

### There are two types of recommendation systems:

-Content-based filtering
-Collaborative filtering

A Restaurant recommendation system uses content-based filtering. This method only uses information about the description and attributes of items that users have previously consumed to model user preferences.

In other words, these algorithms try to recommend things similar to what a user liked in the past. The dataset I’ll be using here consists of restaurants in Bangalore, India, collected from Zomato.

To create the Restaurant recommendation system, I will create a content-based recommendation system where when I enter the name of a restaurant, the Restaurant recommendation system will look at reviews from other restaurants, and System will recommend us to the other restaurants with similar reviews and sort them from the top-rated.

Techniques used in the project:

1. Deleting unnecessary columns
2. Removing the duplicates
3. Removing the NaN values from the dataset
4. Changing and correcting the column names
5. Data Transformations
6. Data cleaning
7. Text cleaning
